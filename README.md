# Level-Border
description of level border 
Level Border is a modpack what it's all about with every level you get the border goes up 1 level, the goal is to complete the quest and not die, if you have done that you have successfully played through the mod pack and can look forward to part 2, but there will be plenty of updates and renewals as well as mods quests ect, I also have a discord server where you can report if there are bugs or dupe glitches
